          <h1>My Dream Girl <3<br>This is the first girl I admired in my college life, Hazel Joy Salarozan. I admired her for her cuteness, soft voice, and adorable Kinaray-a accent. Although our journey ended after the first semester due to her school transfer, I'll always cherish our memories.</h1>

          <h1>My Dream Woman <3<br> The difference between a woman and a girl is that a girl is not yet fully matured physically, emotionally, or socially. while a woman  is considered to have reached full physical, emotional, and social maturity.<br><br>Anyway admiring and falling in love to her was actually unexpected the feeling of comfort that when you open up private matters I was not judged by her, instead she learned my past to know me better and comforted me in a way I never experienced before and till this day no matter what happens to our friendship I'm thankful for her precense and our memories that we made but even if we have a small issue right now but no matter what happens I'll never hate her and still be her 1 call away friend. </h1>

      <h1>My New so called COF in my college journey <3<br>They may not be the best cirlce of friends I could as for but I'm thankful still for treating me like a true friend, I maybe not join them in playing valorant but valorant is not really for me I guess and our circle of friends maybe small but I'm thankful that we are true to ourself our friendship and we don't talk shit behind our backs also forging our friendship was also unexpected due to certain circumstances we forged a trio friendship that is like a brotherhood also even though we are just a trio we are not like the others that even though they are a big cirlce of friends they still talk shit behind their backs and destroy each others reputation and I'm glad that we don't do that we are keeping our friendship real like true brothers.</h1>
