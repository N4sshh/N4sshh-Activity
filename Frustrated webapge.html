                            First, I would like to address how disappointed and frustrated I am with my final grade. I simply cannot understand how or why this has happened. Is it acceptable for you to destroy someone's dream of becoming a dean's lister or cum laude just like that? If I'm being honest, I don't even like the way you teach. When you asked if we understood your lesson, I should have said no. I could not understand a thing you were saying because of how quickly you teach. Is that also how quickly you give someone an INC?

                <br><br>    I simply cannot express how frustrated I am with the quality of your teaching. Your explanations are not understandable, and the pace at which you cover the material is overwhelming. It feels as though you are not considering the students' ability to keep up. This situation has caused me significant distress and has made me question my place in this prestigious school. To be completely honest, being here with you as a professor makes me want to start a new life in a new school with no professors like you. I hope you understand the impact this has had on my academic journey and my aspirations for the future.

                <br><br>    Moreover, I may not have always been a diligent student, dedicated to achieving high academic standards. However, I have put in countless hours of study and effort, only to be met with a grade that does not reflect my commitment. The lack of clear instruction and the rapid pace of your lessons have left me feeling lost and defeated. It is incredibly disheartening to see my hard work go unrecognized and to feel as though my academic goals are slipping away because of factors beyond my control.

                <br><br>    Additionally, it is not just me who feels this way. Many of my peers have expressed similar concerns about your teaching methods. We often discuss how difficult it is to follow along in your classes and how demoralizing it is to face assessments that seem disconnected from the material we have been taught. This widespread sense of frustration indicates a serious issue that needs to be addressed. Education is meant to be a supportive and enriching experience, but in your class, it feels more like an obstacle course designed to trip us up rather than help us learn and grow.

                <br><br>   In conclusion, I urge you to reconsider your teaching approach and to take our feedback seriously. We are here to learn, and we need guidance that is clear, compassionate, and effective. The impact of a professor's teaching style on a student's academic success and overall well-being cannot be overstated. I hope you will take this opportunity to reflect on how you can better support your students in achieving their academic dreams, rather than inadvertently hindering them.
