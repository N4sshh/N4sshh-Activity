          <h1>"You know, I had a lot of things I wanted to do... I wanted to be a teacher... I also wanted to be an astronaut... and also make my own cake shop... I wanted to go to the sweets bakery and say, 'I want one of everything'... Oh, I wish I could have five lives! Then I could have been born in five different towns, and eaten five lifetime's worth of food, and had five different careers, and... fallen in love with the same person, five times." - Furukawa Nagisa
