          <h1>My Childhood Bestfriend <3<br>The first girl I treated like a princess even though I was a bully towards her, our journey together was not that long but it was a wonderful experience and a memory to be remembered. We part ways on graduation and till this day have not met since then, but these memories will never fade till this day I still quite regret being a bully towards her I was quite a menace of a child back then but I was also the one being bullied all the time but still she treated me as a bestfriend and appreciated my small efforts of walking her home before I go home and all of those after class games was truly a rememberable childhood memory for me, no matter how awful my childhood was she was one of those people who truly gave me a childhood memory to be remembered.<br><br>Thankyou so much for everything janniela B Canillo <3</h1>

          <h1>My Long Time Bestfriend <3<br>The first girl bestfriend I had when I was starting my Highschool journey, It's been around 7-8 years since we became bestfriends truly a long journey for us even though today we don't have that much conversations and pictures together we still have each others backs no matter what happens we're still bestfriends or more like step siblings, these past 7 years was a kind of fast I was not really expecting that our friendship could last this long but I guess if you truly have a true friend no matter what the issue or the circumstances the friendship will last I can't express myself how thankful I am with the friendship we made through out the years and I can't express all the words that I'm thinking but all I can say is I'm forever thankful and happy to have a wonderful bestfriend or step sibling type of relationship with her.<br><br> Once again Thankyou so much for everything Jenny Mercado <3</h1>

        <h1>My First so called Online Bestfriend <3<br>I met her online during COVID-19 and I was not actually expecting much due to the fact that most people you will know online will just disappear and you will not even notice, but I was not expecting to forge a truly memorable friendship that was made online, We are at our point in life that we are busy due to responsibilities but it was actually one of the best moments that happend during the covid time she's treating me like her little bro and I'm treating her like the big sister I never had was a wonderful experience to have in my life we made quite some memories and alot of memorable once also but I'm really thankful for having her and get to know her during my journey in life experiencing a sisters love is a truly genuine experience.<br><br> Once again thankyou for everything Arnelle Joy Brillantes <3</h1>

      <h1>The Best Bestfriend <3<br>Tbh I was not expecting a friend that would also last a long time but she was the one who really made me a somehow a person who's now aware of the world back then I was actually so immature and JEJE type of person but her influence made better or change from  being a JEJE type of kid to a SHIT POSTER, or a person who loves to shit post and talk shit haha but her influence is really a big help for me to at least how to fix myself in someway and we are just vibing she was the best circle of friend I could ask for even though I'm one year older getting to know her and vibing with her is just so amazing if you know what I mean it's like you don't want to go home and just vibe and vibe having her as a bestfriend is like a treasure it's like finding a diamond in a pile of gravel it's unexpected but at the same time so precious i can't express myself on how thankful I am to meet her and to vibe with her and we might not talk that much but giving our circumstances in life it's understandble but no matter what happens she will always be the best bestfriend I could ever ask for.<br><br> Once again Thankyou so much for everything Jewelgrace Bayoneta <3</h1>
